# IRC-v2 and ircutils

The IRC-v2 project consists of  an irc library called ircutils and a simple client.

* The messages are parsed using a handwritten FSM.

* The library incorporates actions and events.

# Status
The parser and the network bits are stable, the UI architecture is still in development. The library may undergo some light changes. New features will be added. 

# History
I've been meaning to write an irc client for a long time. This is my second attempt using Go hence irc-v2. The parser is a handwritten FSM. I am working on the code in my free time. 

# What can you do with it?
As ircutils is a general purpose library supporting actions and events, you could write your own module to anything. You could write irc bots, irc clients, irc bridges etc.

# Don't hesitate to comment or contribute!
* Any help/input will be greatly appriciated.
